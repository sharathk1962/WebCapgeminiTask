# WebCapgeminiTask

I have automated the assigned task using Webdriver IO.

Have used Mocha framework and also have used Allure reports.

In one of the .js file I have covered and validated both the mentioned scenrios using chai- assertion concept.

One is creating account and validating the username once the user craeted, Second one is adding items to the cart and validatig the added item name.

Have also done all the setup required for the WebDriverIO framework from scratch by running different npm commands.
